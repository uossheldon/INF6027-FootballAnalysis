# International Football Match Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores international football match trends and dynamics using a dataset of over 47,000 matches spanning from 1872 to 2017. The research focuses on uncovering insights into home advantage, temporal scoring patterns, confederation-wise performance, and match outcomes. The project incorporates advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

## Dataset

**Dataset Name:** International Football Results  
**Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)  
**Description:** A dataset of international football matches with detailed records on scores, venues, and match types. Three key files (`results.csv`, `goalscorers.csv`, `shootouts.csv`) provide a robust basis for analysis and predictive modeling.

## Project Modules

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Scripts:**

- `confederation_match_outcome_rates_table_heatmap.R`
- `first_shooter_analysis.R`
- `goal_difference_analysis.R`
- `goal_time_distribution.R`

**Key Insights:**

- Trends in match outcomes by venue and confederation.
- Timing patterns of goals and key events.

### 2. Home Advantage Analysis

**Scripts:**

- `home_advantage_analysis.R`
- `home_win_rate_analysis.R`

**Key Insights:**

- Significant advantages for home teams in scoring and winning.
- Temporal shifts in home advantage over historical eras.

### 3. Penalty and Own Goal Analysis

**Scripts:**

- `penalty_own_goal_analysis.R`

**Key Insights:**

- Analysis of penalty and own goal trends across venues.
- Their role in match outcomes.

### 4. Machine Learning for Match Outcome Prediction

**Python Implementation:** `train_model.py`  
**R Implementation:** `train_model.R`

**Process:**

- **Preprocessing:** Feature engineering and dataset transformation.
- **Modeling:** Utilized LightGBM to predict outcomes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win).
- **Evaluation:** Achieved ~82.21% accuracy (Python) and ~79.75% accuracy (R).

**Outputs:** Confusion matrices, feature importance visualizations, and evaluation metrics.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uossheldon/INF6027-FootballAnalysis.git
cd INF6027-FootballAnalysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

- **Python:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

- **R:**
```r
install.packages(c("data.table", "lightgbm", "caret", "ggplot2"))
```
For `lightgbm`, ensure the correct C++ environment is configured.

### 3. Prepare Data:
Place the required CSV files (`results.csv`, `goalscorers.csv`, `shootouts.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

### 4. Run Scripts:

- **R Analysis Scripts:**
```r
Rscript scripts/confederation_match_outcome_rates_table_heatmap.R
Rscript scripts/home_advantage_analysis.R
# Add other scripts as needed
```

- **Python Machine Learning:**
```bash
python ml/train_model.py
```

### 5. View Outputs:
Results will be stored in the `outputs/` directory, organized into subfolders like `visuals/` and `tables/`.
